## 1. Business Recommendation
As there were no given frames for the project I recommend following approaches for
following use cases:

* __Money and/or time constraints:__  To save time (and thus money) rather use
a UI libary such as react-md, bootstrap, etc.; In general keep Stack lean to reduce time expenses.

* __Focus on product leadership and/or enterprise solutions:__ In order to create a high quality product components 
can be created individually. An external UI library is limited in customization and also includes unnecessary functions, thus
performance and design can be impaired. For bigger projects also see the section 'Recommendations for Scaling'.


As I had no constraints I went for a lean stack (to keep time expense small), but created individualized 
components (for being freely creative in design).
